    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Effective Date: June 24, 2025</p>

    <p>
      <strong>Summarizer</strong> (“we,” “our,” or “us”) values your privacy.
      This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and protect your
      information when you use our Chrome Extension and related services.

        prevention and functionality tracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Payment Data:</strong> Payments are processed securely via
        Razorpay. We do not store your credit/debit card details. Razorpay may
        collect payment identifiers and pass us a transaction ID.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Support Communication:</strong> When you contact us via EmailJS,
        we collect your name, email, and message content to help resolve your
        issue.

    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the extension's services.</li>
      <li>To track and manage usage credits.</li>

    <h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>When legally required (e.g., to comply with law enforcement).</li>
      <li>
        To trusted third-party processors (like Razorpay and EmailJS) necessary
        for service delivery.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take appropriate security measures (SSL, restricted access, data
      minimization) to protect your data. However, no online service is 100%
      secure.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
      You can request access to, correction of, or deletion of your data by
